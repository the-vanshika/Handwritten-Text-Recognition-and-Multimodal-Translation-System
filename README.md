# Handwritten Text Recognition and Multimodal Translation System

## Overview
This project presents an advanced **Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) and Multimodal Translation System**, integrating **OCR, NLP, ASR, and Sign Language Conversion**. The system is designed to recognize handwritten text, translate it into multiple languages, convert complex words into simpler meanings, and provide accessibility through speech-to-text and sign language animation.

## Features
- **OCR-Based Handwritten Text Recognition**: Converts scanned handwritten text into machine-readable text.
- **Neural Machine Translation (NMT)**: Translates text into multiple languages using deep learning models.
- **Difficult Meaning Finder**: Identifies and simplifies complex words while preserving the original meaning.
- **Speech-to-Text (ASR) Processing**: Converts spoken language into text with high accuracy.
- **Sign Language Conversion**: Generates sign language gestures from spoken or textual input using animated rendering.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Optimized for real-time use across multiple devices.

## System Architecture
The system follows a **modular pipeline** approach with the following stages:
1. **Input Processing**: Handwritten text, audio, or typed text is taken as input.
2. **OCR Processing**: Text extraction from images using deep learning-based OCR models.
3. **Translation Module**: Text is translated into the target language using NMT models.
4. **Difficult Meaning Finder**: Complex words are simplified for better readability.
5. **Speech-to-Text Processing**: Converts spoken input into textual format.
6. **Sign Language Animation**: Generates gestures for text or spoken input.
7. **Output Generation**: The system provides translated text or sign language animations.
